# Overview of DeployTrackerMVC
The main function of this program is to help assist the communication between the developers and the QA team. Currently, both teams use a chat client to communicate not only issues, but callouts of deploys and "smoke" pass status'. On a busy day, things can start to get lost in translation, requiring both teams to scroll through the chat log to determine the status of deploys/smokes. This program will help close that gap, as its sole purpose is to display the status of deploy rollouts in tabular form, WITH an added bonus: IN REAL TIME!
